*Test 2: Comprehensive Loop Operations*
*Constant loops, variable loops, countdown behavior, nested loops, edge cases*

*1. Constant loops*
write "Constant loop test (5 times): ";
repeat 5 times write "*";
write newline;

*2. Variable loop with countdown behavior*
number countdown;
countdown := 4;
write "Variable countdown (should show 4,3,2,1):" and newline;
repeat countdown times {
    write "  countdown = " and countdown and newline;
}
write "After loop: countdown = " and countdown and newline;

*3. Nested loops*
number outer;
number total;
outer := 3;
total := 0;
write "Nested loops test:" and newline;
repeat outer times {
    write "Outer loop: " and outer and newline;
    repeat 2 times {
        write "  Inner iteration" and newline;
        total += 1;
    }
}
write "Total inner iterations: " and total and newline;

*4. Edge cases*
write "Zero loop test:" and newline;
repeat 0 times write "Should not appear";
write "Zero loop completed." and newline;

write "Single iteration test:" and newline;
repeat 1 times write "Single iteration" and newline;

*5. Variable loop modification during execution*
number loop_var;
number sum;
loop_var := 3;
sum := 0;
write "Loop with arithmetic during execution:" and newline;
repeat loop_var times {
    write "  loop_var = " and loop_var and newline;
    sum += loop_var;
}
write "Final sum: " and sum and newline;

write "Test 2 completed successfully!" and newline;
